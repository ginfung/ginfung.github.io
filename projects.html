                           Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related systems whose members can be distinguished by the set of features they provide.  Feature model is the tree-like structure which can expressed the relationship between the features in the SPLs. Beyond the tree-like relationship, there are many other cross-tree constraints, which make the model complex. How to find a best product line configuration has been proved as a NP-hard problem.<br>

                            Nearly all Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are plagued with slow convergence rates, and hence each requires a large number of function evaluations to approximate the Pareto Frontier (PF). This has resulted inslow adoption of MOEAs to Searh-based SE problems, where function evaluations are very expensive. This project is trying to answer the following questions:
                            <li>Can Sampling be as good as Mutation (or standard MOEA)?</li>
                            <li>Can Sampling on Large population be as good as Mutation (or standard MOEA)?</li>
                            <li>Can Sampling on Large population, with an intelligent initial population generatorbe as good as Mutation (or standard MOEA)?</li>

                            Netflix Prize competition was hold by Netflix Inc. in Oct 2006. The main goal of this competition was to predict how many score a user will rate for a movie, by learning a test set containing nearly 100 million customer rating records. In this project, we learned the data from this competition.<br>
                            Given the 100 million customer rating records, we focused on the following tasks:

                                <li>Predict the existed records by data analysis techniques (Decision tree, ANN, KNN, etc.). Compute the RMSE (Root mean squared error) of different model, and then compare them.</li>
                                <li>Forecast whether one customer will be in favor of one released movie.</li>
                                <li>Given essential information (directors, genres, casts, etc) of a movie, predict which group of customers will love it, and which group of customers will dislike it.</li>

                            In this project, we studied the differential geometry of NURBS surfaces, optimized the equiareality of given NURBS surfaces using Mobius transformations. More specifically, I provided an explicit solution for Bezier/ B-spline surfaces and numerical solutions for NURBS to render the coefficients of the Mobius transformations. Finally, we gave some examples to show the performance of our algorithm.

                            In the project, we try to improve the conformity of NURBS surfaces by an optimization algorithm using general bilinear transformations.

                            In this interesting project, we tried to develop a music information retrieval system. We developed a model to “describe” the characteristic of the song. When the humming sound collected by an android app, we calculated the main characteristic of the sound and matched it from our database.

                            Clustering plays an increasingly important role in data mining and data analysis. We illustrated an improved clustering algorithm- K-means Algorithm, which can be accomplished much more easily and faster than many other similar algorithm.

                            This is my course design of Data Structure class. To begin this course design, I first studied the structure of B-Tree and the common operation upon it. Then I wrote a B-Tree using C++, analyzed the spatial complexity and time complexity of the B-Tree and its operation. Finally, I also compared this data structure with other similar data structure-B* Tree, B+ Tree
